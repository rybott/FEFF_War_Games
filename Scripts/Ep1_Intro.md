# Ep 1 - Generating Sales / Rev
## Section 1 - Intro
### Visuals

### Script
Welcome to Episode 1 of my mini docu-series where I attempt to create a program that generates a synthetic company. 

You may be asking yourself, who is he? what is that? and what's the point? 

Let's start with me:
- MY name is Ryan and I have a degree in Froensic Accounting, working towards my Masters in Accounting and CPA License. I hope to use this series to organize my thoughts and illistrate my ideas with ground breaking visials and an Oscar Winning performance. 

- This Generator is exactly what is seems, a python program that creates a complete set of finanical data for a company of the users choice. 

- After some cursory research, I found this is more or less a novel Idea, atleast online. Thats probably because people much smarter than me create real companies that make real money, and don't have to make fake ones in their moms basement that make zero money. I could have been a plumber. Anyway, this company is objectively way cooler, if you only asked my mom. Unlike a real, revenue generating buisness, this company can be anything the user imagines. And that is the important part, because this is phase one of the project, Generating a company based off a whole bunch of criteria such as years in business, type of products, etc. We will get into all of that in a minute. But the main use of the companies is to destroy them. I want to inject fraud after fraud, error after company destroying error until this fake companies fake ceo is on their hands and knees begging for the hero Forensic accountant (ME) to come in and sort them out, using machine learning. I needed a test bed that I could train ML models on, because for some reasons, no one would give a student with 6 months of coding experience play around in their financial databases, rude. 

Insert talking about the Oerview

Clearly this is a long indeavor but I hope by creating these videos it forces me to focus and reflect on my creation, being more delibret and making a better non-revenue generating project I've already spent months of my life on.

- This is where my project got it's name, and it is very sad that none of the one friend I have understood, it is a spoof of the classic movie War Games, and the device that would predict conflict for the US, which is what this does with fraud, genius. Between this and the high production quality of these videos, it is ok if you thought I hired a marketing director, but its all me baby.
