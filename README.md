# FEFF War Games
### I wanted to create a spoof of the War Games that give scenario's for war time actions and strategy. This is a python game with three objects, create a company, incorporate fraud, and host an interface for the user to identify the frauds. 

## Learning Objectives
### Forenisc Accounting
- A Refresher on the Fraud Tree and relevant red flags to look for
  - The Frauds used in this game can be found in the {frauds.md} file
  - All of these frauds will be represented through there repective red flags
- Out of textbook, real world exlusive experience: Taking what I have learned and researching more about the operations of a company for the purposes of forensic accounting, but some parts of the created company were altered or simplified for this purpose.
### Databases
- This program required extensive use of a relational SQL Database, which held all of the information and randomly generated forms.
### Python
- The Creation of Games and ineractive interfaces
- Logic, Order, and Organization of Code for ease of use and readability.

## Functionality
### Creation of The Buisness
- Name: Bonanni Suits
- Product: Custom Luxury Suits
- Employees
  - CEO: Tim T.
  - Manager/Aquisitions: Sarah F.
  - HR: Terry G.
  - Suit Makers (3): Sam G. Curtis T. Ryan B.
    - For Simplicity all employees will make $5,000 a year
### Implimentation of Fraud 
- To start, just one fraud will be present, as mutiple random frauds might overlap too much, but in the future I will add a selection of up to 8.
- In addition, there are scenarios, which are a group of related frauds that fit together towards one employees actions.
- All documents will be created each of the time, it will be up to the user to determine which ones contain irregulairites
- In the future I will also add different companies that will cover even more frauds. 
### Game Play
- The User will be greeted with an outline of the buisness they were hired to investigate, they will push the big button called fraud.
- Users will then be given access to a slew of files, journal entries, and reports, that are auto generated.
- There will be a button on this page that brings the player to an end page, in which they will be able to select one of many frauds, and if they get it wrong, a title card giving them information will appear about the fraud they chose. If they will it will tell them they won, include the info about the fraud, and given all of the evidence for that fraud, but there will be able one or two pieces of evidece per fraud.
