# FEFF War Games
### I wanted to create a spoof of the War Games that give scenario's for war time actions and strategy. This is a python game with three objects, create a company, incorporate fraud, and host an interface for the user to identify the frauds. 

## Learning Objectives
### Forenisc Accounting
- A Refresher on the Fraud Tree and relevant red flags to look for
  - The Frauds used in this game can be found in the {frauds.md} file
  - All of these frauds will be represented through there repective red flags
- Out of textbook, real world exlusive experience: Taking what I have learned and researching more about the operations of a company for the purposes of forensic accounting, but some parts of the created company were altered or simplified for this purpose.
### Databases
- This program required extensive use of a relational SQL Database, which held all of the information and randomly generated forms.
### Python
- The Creation of Games and ineractive interfaces
- Logic, Order, and Organization of Code for ease of use and readability.
