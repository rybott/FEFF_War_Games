I can rollup up the inventory levels into the PO dataframe in an easily queriable date field that I can pull out and use as the begining and end Inventory Levels. Then you can also purchases straight from the same database, and then compare them to INV_Dec, youll have a COGS on a quarterly basis.\n",
