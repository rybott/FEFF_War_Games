# The Challenges of a computer generated company
11/30/2023 / 
My biggest concern is that the data I generate is useless, and the insights I gain from this project will have no lasting impact on real world analysis, as the real world is complex, but my code is simple and clean. Documented here is my attempt to document and improve the realism of my data, also see my buisness model for a better idea of the process in which I see this model being used. 

## Generating Data 
Random numbers are difficult to produce by a computer, and I believe that there are inherent patterns that emerge in my data more than I would like, especially as I push millions of sales datapoint through the program. This does not include valid relationships such as Revenue and COGS, but instead a pattern in the values and numbers. This may not be a concern and more testing will be needed, but even if these inherent patterns are not emerging, the randomness of my program is still an issue because it is the wrong form of randomness. There should be patterns, seasonality, product demand fluxuations, external factors such as weather. Companies have thousands of factors influencing their final financial statments, too many for anyone to model accurately just through procedural programming alone. That is why I want to take a step back and re factor the code to better include these factors. 

## New Processes for code generation
I have a few ideas for how I would like to take the code base, but everything starts with having financial data. Having a company trust me enought to analyze every transaction they've ever recorded is as far fetched as it sounds, and being able to find this data in the significant quantities needed to replicate it sufficently, that was never going to happen. That is why I started creating my program that gives me that data I needed, but what is publicly avaliable is financial statments for publicly traded companies. This would be the only robust way of accessing the any type of financial data. In my current program, it works from the ground up, as sales are generated and an entire buisness is built on top of them. My original vision was to start with the finacial statements and then work backwards, but XBRL is the worst interface I have ever seen. I understand that it is impossible to truely standarize financial statment reporting, but the SEC picked the worst way. I will give them credit that there is just so much data that this might have been the only way to break it up, and this is a relatively new process that is far supierior to what came before it, but there are some glaring issues. My main issue with XBRL is that tags for values are great, but tags for anything else are non-existent. I wanted the consolidated Income Statment and Balance sheets, and instead I had to filter through every account you are looking for for every company. There is a limit of 10 pulls per minute, which seems like enough, except I needed data from 1000 companies, each with 10-20 accounts per company for what I was looking for. This took two weeks of data collection. I understand this was a massive ammount of data, but I feel there has to be a better middle ground, or if they had an API for that data. There is an API which would have spend the process up emensly, but it costs $200 a month, for free data.
