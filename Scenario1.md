# Scenario One
This is the most basic Scenario for a simple business. A Boutique Merchant that purchases products and then resells them for profit. The business has a storefront.
The COGS includes both the purchase and shipment of products and does not need to be calculated like a manufacturing business.
In this scenario, the company already owns Land and Equipment (Tills, forklifts, etc.). 

## Expenses
### Fixed
Fixed expenses do not change over the years, so instead a variable revenue is calculated for every year, and a variable percent of revenue is 
calculated every year (just like a variable cost) but then those calculated costs per year are added up and divided by the number of months in all 
the years, thus turning a variable cost into a fixed cost. 

- Rent (6% - 10% of Revenue)
- Insurance (2% - 4% of Revenue)
- Wages (15% - 20% of Revenue)

### Variable
- Advertising (6% - 8% of Revenue)
  - is the only variable expense, and is calculated on random days as a percent of the rev

## Other Assets
These are assets not purchased but already on the balance sheet, Land doesn't need to be depreciated but the others do.
In addition, the Balance sheet won't balance unless either liability or equity increases.
- Land
  - Land is increased (Asset) and Retained Earnings is also increased (Equity)
- Equipment
  - Equipment is increased (Asset) and Notes Payable is also increased (Liability)
  - There are Notes payments and Interest Payments from Cash
    - Cash will be *Rev - Exp* but it is important to make sure there is enough cash to cover these payments,
      so at the end of each year, a calculation will see if there is enough cash and then systematically add the
      correct value of Cash on hand to the first year, making sure everything is balanced.
      - Cash is increased (Asset) and Retained Earnings is also increased (Equity)

## Tax
Tax in this scenario is 13% and is taken from the EBITA 
     
## Financial Statments
- Balance Sheet
  - By the end this should be balanced for each of the years
