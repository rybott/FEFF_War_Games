# Scenarios
These are a way to make the programing easier, as trying to develop an entire company that does everything just isn't feesible, instead Scenarios will allow more strict conditions for whatever my current purpose is
similiar to OOP, as each scenario is an iteration of the company generator class. 

## Scenario 1
This is the basic operation scenario, there will be nothing but the bare minimum needed to run a retail business of any size. 
### Expenses Required
- COGS (45%-55%)
- Rent & Utilities (6% - 10%)
- Insurance (2%-4%)
- Salaries & Wages (15%-20%)
- Marketing & Advertising (6%-8%)
---
- Upper Limit = 97% Exp | 3% Profit Margin
- Lowwer Limit = 74% Exp | 26% Profit Margin
  - Can be anywhere between these two metrics
- Then Taxes
