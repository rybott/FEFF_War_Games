# Inventory Evanluation

## Current COGS Method

## LIFO FIFO

## Periodic vs Perpetual
### Current Method
- Currently I use a Periodic Method, as for each product, sales are grouped by quarter and then checked against inventory, if it would make inventory negative, 1.05% is added and the purchase is recorded. 
### Why I use Periodic
- The Perpetual Method would record the deduction of inventory through sales wthi every invoice
- I use the Periodic for two reasons
    1. The biggest reason is the processing power necessary to process the hundreds of thousands of invoices that are generated
    2. The other reason is the way that I generate PO's based solely on sales. This process means that I can not divorce the Sales from the PO's
### Why Perpetual would be better
- Recording purchase orders like this is not the best way of doing it, and it would be best to have a dedicated generator that takes granular user input and generates purchases divorced from sales, just as it is in real life. 
- Eventually when I use the Perpetual System, and figure out the processing demands, I will the ability to work on modeling things such as inventory level predictions, rising and falling demand, etc.
