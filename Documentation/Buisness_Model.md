## Executive Summary

- **Mission:** Reduce cost and time burdens of yearly audit using state-of-the-art machine learning solutions.
- **Vision:** To create the Gold Standard of audit software, and to become SEC required for all publicly traded companies.

## Problem Statement

Publicly traded companies need to have costly and time intensive yearly auditsm, and still Fraud and Errors slip through the cracks costing companies and stakeholders Billions ever year. This is because Audits are done by auditors who deal with far too much work in time constraints. 

## Solution

A robust machine learning software package that can perform an audit on the entire company every day by monitoring, detecting, and reporting irregularities in real-time.

## Value Proposition

- Real-time monitoring and daily reports on possible red flags.
- Cost-saving by way of reduced fraudulent and Error based losses as well as personnel and company resources.
- 3rd party reports and attestation for yearly external audits, decreasing the budget and time requirments needed. Or optional provided 3rd part audit for the companies we work for. 

## Target Market

- Large Coporations with high yearly audit costs
- As the company grows, smaller companies with less robust historical records can be taken on. 

## Revenue Model

- **Instalation:** Proper training and understanding of the company will require atleast a year as their external auditor. This will be less needed the more the company grows.
- **Enterprise solutions:** Custom pricing for specific needs in reporting and reports

## Issues to Overcome

- **Distinct Buisness:** For the same reason External Audits can not be stadnardized, neither can this solution. Each company has different revenue streams, reporting methods, discolure methods, etc. This will require much research and understanding of the company, which can be done by reviewing external audits of prior years as well as becoming the external audit for the company duirng the instalation period. 
- **Historical Data:** For predictive modeling, large ammounts of similiar data is required. Some companies might have poor records or no histroical records that are usable for the models. 
### Solution

**Expansion:** Both of these issues will be solved with a robust system. With a large aggregate of data, both issues can solved. If the company deals will more companies, then it is more likely that each relevant difference discussed in the first issue will be captured in scanning for irregularities. Until then, another solution is a robust set of rules and checks hardcoded into the software that will catch irreguarlities even if the predicitive models don't, while also training said models.
